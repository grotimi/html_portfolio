<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Gabriel, i am 18 years of age ,i was born in Lagos Nigeria but was raised in Benin City . I am an undergraduate, i was a student of the Universite of Benin [UNIBEN], studying Machanical engineering before i moved to sweden. Machanical engineering was indeed a challenging course to study because, it was all about Mathematics and physics and the lecturers are not making things eaisy for the student. </p>
<p>I live in sweden for about three month now and it is alot diffrent from Nigeria . I continued my school here in sweden although i had to start all over . When i got to sweden , i decided to go for a change of career because, i fell in with WEB DEVELOPMENT[PROGRAMMING], and i hope to become a programmer soon. </p>
